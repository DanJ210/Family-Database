I want to reiterate the skills I learned throughout school and througout my learning
endeavor online. So I'm going to create a fun little web app for my entire family where
they can go to a site and register their info as a member of the family which will then
grant them access to some special content. Something maybe like a family social network.

I want to do this for fun, practice, and because I'm stuck up in NC all alone right now
and I'm incredibly bored with some intense cabin fever!
